How To Score
------------

Each contestant's score is found using the following algorithm:

Score = Scoring Multiplier \* \[Scoring Bin Total + Marked Side - Penalties\]

1.  Scoring Bin Total - The sum of the total points scored by placing colored foam blocks into the various scoring bins. The points are assigned to the contestant by color (e.g. red player gets points for any red block placed in a bin). The point distribution is as shown in the figure.

Scoring Total.

2.  Marked Side - Each foam block has a single marked side. Each block placed in a bin with the marked side facing towards the front of the table is worth an additional 10 points
3.  Scoring Multiplier - A scoring multiplier will be awarded for placing your colored blocks in a continuous segment. The segment can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, see examples ({{% resource_link cca4fb0b-0b6a-8af7-af90-607ae0b1d2a7 "PDF" %}}). The initial multiplier will be 1 and the highest multiplier achieved will be used in the final score calculation. 3 Block Segment = 2x Multiplier 4 Block Segment = 3x Multiplier
4.  Penalties - A 50 point penalty will be assessed if any part of a contestantâ€™s machine crosses the center line before placing 2 blocks in the bottom row or 1 block in a higher row.

Rules
-----

1.  Timing
    *   Each round of the contest is 45 seconds long.
    *   Contestants must be able to setup and remove their machines from the contest table within 30 seconds.
2.  Winning
    *   The winner is the contestant with the highest score at the end of the round.
    *   Each contestant's score is found using the following algorithm:  
        Score = Scoring Multiplier \* \[Scoring Bin Total + Marked Side - Penalties\]
        *   Scoring Bin Total - The sum of the total points scored by placing colored foam blocks into the various scoring bins. Blocks placed in the bottom row (10 points) must be completely within the bin. Blocks placed in the top three horizontal rows are required to be at least 50% by volume within the bin. The points are assigned to the contestant by color (e.g. red player gets points for any red block placed in a bin). The point distribution is as follows.
            *   Marked Side - Each foam block has a single marked side. Each block placed in a bin with the marked side facing towards the front of the table is worth an additional 10 points.
            *   Scoring Multiplier - A scoring multiplier will be awarded for placing your colored blocks in a continuous segment. The segment can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, see examples (PDF). The initial multiplier will be 1 and the highest multiplier achieved will be used in the final score calculation.  
                3 Block Segment = 2x Multiplier  
                4 Block Segment = 3x Multiplier
            *   Penalties - A 50 point penalty will be assessed if any part of a contestant's machine crosses the center line before placing 2 blocks in the bottom row or 1 block in a higher row.
    *   Seeding rounds will be held during the lab time. Machines will compete against the table unopposed. A contestant's seed will be determined by their score and the staff's discretion.
    *   Deliberate damage or destruction of an opponent, the contest table, or a control box will result in disqualification! See 5a-c below.
3.  Driving
    *   Contestants must drive their own machines.
    *   Contestants may have one person help drive their machine (e.g. trigger a mechanism at a certain time, etc.)
    *   Contestants and Assistant Drivers must wear safety glasses (prescription glasses are acceptable) when in the vicinity of the table.
4.  Starting Configuration
    *   On the day before the competition, your machine will be size-checked. It must fit into the 16"x16"x26" sizing box including the remote control receiver box and batteries in its starting configuration. Oversize machines must compete, but are not eligible to win.
    *   Machines will also be weighed on the day before the competition. Machines must weigh no more than 10 lbs. (4.54 kg.), not including batteries and the control box.
    *   When setup on the table prior to the start of a round (the starting configuration), machines must be completely within the colored line. No part of the machine may extend onto this line until the start of the contest. When the machine is set up in the starting zone, it must still fit within a volume less than or equal to the internal volume of the sizing box. The box can be in any orientation as long as it remains completely within the starting zone.
    *   During the setup process, contestants may "attach" their machines to the table, but would do well to be mindful of rule 5g-i.
    *   No energy may be stored in the rubber bands prior to the start of the contest.
    *   Foam cubes: Prior to the start of each round, the staff will place the foam cubes on each table as shown above. The marked side will start facing down.
    *   Contestants will be responsible for charging the batteries included with their drill for the contest. Contestants may only use one battery per machine.
5.  During the Round
    *   Machines should be prepared for interaction with their opponent, but malicious destruction of an opponent's machine will not be tolerated. The judges will disqualify contestants who in their opinion have maliciously damaged an opponent's machine.
    *   A machine may not cross the center line until that contestant has placed 2 blocks in the bottom row or 1 block in a higher row. A 50 point penalty will be assessed for a violation of this rule. Once a contestant has crossed the line for any reason, the opponent may also cross the line without receiving the penalty.
    *   Contestants who damage any element of the table or either of the control boxes may be disqualified. The table will not be disqualified for damaging contestants' machines. As above, the judges will act at their discretion.
    *   Contestants (i.e. the human being) may not directly interfere with the motion of the table or the machines.
    *   Contestants may not interfere with the operation of the provided control system or with the operation of any autonomous control system.
    *   Foam cubes that depart the table will not be re-introduced to the table by contestants (i.e. the human being).
    *   Absolutely no nets or entanglement devices.
    *   Absolutely no spiked wheels.
    *   No dangerous machines. The "naked phone booth" rule will apply at all times!

Supreme Court Decisions and Rule Clarifications
